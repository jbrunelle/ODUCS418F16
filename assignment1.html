  <h3>Task 1: The List</h3>
  <p>In this course, communication from me to the class and you to your classmates will be done via a mailing list. Task 1 of this assignment is to simply register for this list. To do so:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Join the mailing list at Google Group <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oducs518f16">oducs518f16@googlegroups.com</a></li>
    <li>Upon receive an e-mail confirming registration to the list, send an e-mail simply saying, "Hello World".
  </li></ol>
  <p>You will need to request to join. Once approved, you may post your messages. My receipt of this this message will be confirmation that you are registered for the list.</p>

  <h3>Task 2: Get Git</h3>
  <p>Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that we will use in this course to submit assignment and develop our respective codebases. To use Git from your local machine, you must first install the Git environment. Your operating system may already have Git installed. Type <code>git --version</code> at your command-line to verify this. If an error similar to "command not found" is returned, consult the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git homepage</a> to install the program for your operating system or ask <a href="TBD">The List</a>.</p>

  <h3>Task 3: Interfacing with the <span title="GitHub&#39;s mascot">Octocat</span></h3>  
  <p>In this course, we will use GitHub for assignment submission from our local Git repositories. Assignments will not be submitted via Blackboard, e-mail, etc. Documents in Git reside in a "repository", accessible using both the <code>git://</code> protocol and through the web interface on GitHub at <code>https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname</code>.</p>
  
  
   
  <h4>3.1 Acquiring a GitHub account</h4>
  <p>GitHub provides an <a href="https://education.github.com/">"Education Account"</a>, which allows five free private Git repositories (for which they usually charge), among many other benefits. This will be necessary for the course project. For this assignment, only a standard GitHub account is needed. Given the education account requires verification on their end, I recommend acquiring the free student account early.</p>
  

 <h4>3.2 Create A Repository for Your Course Project</h4>
<p>Create a blank repository ("repo" henceforth) under your account. The name of the repo can be anything but ODUCS418F16 (this is to prevent a clash for this assignment). In this repo, you will host your project as the course progresses. Add me (GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/jbrunelle">@jbrunelle</a>) as a collaborator to your repo.</p>
    

  <h4>3.3 Associating with the Class Repo</h4>
  <p>
  </p><p>For Task 3, you will clone my public Git repo at <code>https://github.com/jbrunelle/ODUCS418F16/</code> to your local drive. For guidance on how to work with Git, consult the <a href="https://help.github.com/">GitHub help pages</a>. Once you have cloned the repo:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li>Fork the ODUCS418F16 repo to your GitHub account.</li>
  	<li>Clone your fork to your local machine</li>
    <li>Create a new file in the users directory. The file's name should be your ODUCS user ID (no CS user id? <a href="mailto:root@cs.odu.edu">Contact systems</a>). The contents of the file should be the URI of the repo you created in section 3.2 of this assignment.</li>
    <li>Add and commit this file to your local repo.</li>
    <li>Push the update you have made to the repo on your machine to your GitHub account.</li>
    <li>Submit a pull request to my public repo at <code>https://github.com/jbrunelle/ODUCS418F16/</code> with your addition. Be sure not to commit invisible files (e.g., .DS_Store on Mac) -- review <code>.ignore</code>.</li>
  
  <li>Add me (GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/jbrunelle">@jbrunelle</a>) as a collaborator to your repo.</li>
</ol></section>

  <h3>Extras</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Become familiar with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow.com</a> and it's dynamics/structure as a question-and-answer website.</li>
    <li>If you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, PHP and/or JavaScript, try out the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">HTML Validator</a>, <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a>, PHP Lint, <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a>, and <a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a>. Pay particular attention to the subtle differences between the final two.</li>
    <li>Take a look at Google's <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml">HTML/CSS style guide</a>.</li>  
  </ul>

<!--Project 1: Question and Answer site: basic operations
* Create a website at http://www.cs.odu.edu/~yourusername/cs418s15/project1/ that serves as a place for registered users to ask questions to a community of other users (akin to StackOverflow.com).
** You only need to account for this list of users (provided)
* Each question submitted should have a title and content block as well as be associated with the posted user (only registered users can post)
* For each question, allow other users to submit potential answers to the poster.
* Allow the poster to choose the best or correct answer using a user interface element (like SO's checkmark)
* Allow users to vote positively or negatively on the available answers to encourage the poster to pick the most popular one.
